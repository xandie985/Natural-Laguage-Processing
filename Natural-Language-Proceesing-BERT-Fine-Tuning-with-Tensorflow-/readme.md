Project: Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification (TensorFlow)

**Objective:**

Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for binary text classification (e.g., Quora insincere questions dataset) using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Setup:** Install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Model Garden.
2.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Download and import the Quora Insincere Questions dataset.
    *   Split into train, validation, and test sets, addressing class imbalance.
    *   Create TensorFlow Datasets (`tf.data`) for efficient data loading and preprocessing.

3.  **BERT Model Preparation:**
    *   Load a pre-trained BERT model from TensorFlow Hub.
    *   Tokenize and preprocess text data for BERT input (input word IDs, input mask, segment IDs).
    *   Wrap Python functions for preprocessing into TensorFlow operations using `tf.py_function`.

4.  **Model Building:**
    *   Add a classification head (dense layer with sigmoid activation) to the BERT layer.
    *   Compile the model with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

5.  **Fine-tuning:**
    *   Train the model on the training data for a few epochs, validating on the validation set.
    *   Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.

6.  **Evaluation:**
    *   Plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves.
    *   Evaluate the best model on the test set.

**Key Points:**

*   BERT is a powerful transformer-based model for NLP tasks.
*   Fine-tuning allows adapting BERT to specific classification tasks.
*   TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub provide convenient tools for working with BERT.
*   tf.data API enables efficient data input pipelines for training and evaluation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   BERT's architecture consists of multiple transformer encoder blocks.
*   It produces contextualized embeddings for each token in the input sequence.
*   The [CLS] token is often used as the aggregated representation for classification.

**Limitations:**

*   BERT can be computationally expensive to train and fine-tune.
*   Requires significant labelled data for effective fine-tuning.
